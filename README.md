Hi,

I'm experimenting with Javascript (Vue.js), Python (flask, pandas), Machine Learning (Kaggle), Tensorflow (handpose), APIs (geospatial, timeseries) and UI/UX (vuetify, bootstrap) design.


**My stock portfolio app**

Here I am documenting the UI changes my stock portfolio app went through over time:
