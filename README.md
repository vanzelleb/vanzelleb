# Hi there!

I'm experimenting with Javascript, Python, Machine Learning (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/vanzelleb">Kaggle</a>), Tensorflow, APIs and UI/UX design.


### Some of my experiments:

**Stock portfolio app**

An app to visualize stock prices, stop loss limits and to calculate some basic stock portfolio performance statistics.

I am documenting the app's UI evolution over time here:

**Airport home search**

Combines data from Amadeus, Mapbox and Idealista APIs to visualize homes to buy in proximity to Spanish airports (in case you want to be there quick).

Try it out here:

**Hand tracking (The "Om" machine)**

Makes the "Om" sound when bringing your thumb and index finger close together.

Try it out here:

**3D pose tracking**

It's as good as it sounds. Move your hands around in front of your webcam and manipulate the position of 3D objects in the browser. Works best if you stand at least 2 meters away from your webcam.
