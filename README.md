# Hi there!

I'm experimenting with Javascript, Python, Machine Learning (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/vanzelleb">Kaggle</a>), Tensorflow, APIs and UI/UX design.

### Some of my experiments:

**Stock portfolio app**

An app to visualize stock prices, stop loss limits and to calculate some basic stock portfolio performance statistics.

I am documenting the app's UI evolution over time here:

**Airport home search**

Combines data from Amadeus, Mapbox and Idealista APIs to visualize homes to buy in proximity to Spanish airports (in case you want to be there quick).

**Hand tracking (The "Om" machine)**

Makes the "Om" sound when bringing your thumb and index finger close together.

Try it out here:

**3D pose tracking (and ball play)**

It's as good as it sounds. Move your hands around in front of your webcam and manipulate the position of 3D objects in the browser. Works best if you stand at least 2m away from your computer.
